# Interesting Places

A basic CRUD application for points-of-interest.

## The basic idea

There is a lot that can be done, but time is short!
Here are some essentials:

* User creates account and logs in
* Creates groups of places
* Places have associated data
* User stores groups in account
* The data is accessible via an API
* The API is documented
