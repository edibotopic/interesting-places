# Interesting Places

A basic CRUD application for points-of-interest.

## The basic idea

There is a lot that can be done, but time is short!
Here are some essentials:

* User creates account and logs in
* Creates groups of places
* Places have associated data
* User stores groups in account
* The data is accessible via an API
* The API is documented

## Todo

- [ ] Minimal extension to model (e.g., name, category, description, analytics, lat, lng)
- [ ] Add enhancements (e.g., user images, admin user)
- [ ] API docs
- [ ] Deploy
- [ ] Refresh readme

## Questions

* How could the user model need to be adapted for the new concept?
